Mojo in Fuchsia features intriguingly extensive language support. C/C++, Dart, Go, Java, Python, and Rust are all first-class citizens of the platform. I am guessing that C/C++ is for native development, Go is for networking, Java is for Android, Python is for scripting, and Rust is for writing portions of the kernel. Mixing and matching languages aside, the main UI API is based on, yes, Dart.

+ Conditional statement (if one thing is true then some other thing also has to be true)
+ Existential statement (There is at least one thing for which some something is true)

### Sets

 + Set-Roster notation:  {1, 2, 3}
 + Set-Builder notation: {x ∈ S | P(x)}
     The set of all elements x in S such that P(x) is true.
     
 ### subset
 
 A ⊆ B: A is a subset of B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B.
 
 A ⊄ B: There is at least one element of A that is not an element of B.
 
 A is a proper subset of B if every element of A is in B but there is at least one element of B that is not in A.
 
 ### ordered pairs
 
 Elements of a set are not ordered.
 
 An ordered pair can be denoted as {{a}, {a,b}} or simply (a, b)
