Mojo in Fuchsia features intriguingly extensive language support. C/C++, Dart, Go, Java, Python, and Rust are all first-class citizens of the platform. I am guessing that C/C++ is for native development, Go is for networking, Java is for Android, Python is for scripting, and Rust is for writing portions of the kernel. Mixing and matching languages aside, the main UI API is based on, yes, Dart.
