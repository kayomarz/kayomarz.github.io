## Hash function

A **hash** function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. 

A **cryptographic hash** function is a special class of hash function. It
is a designed to be a one-way function, that is, a function which is infeasible
to invert. Bruce Schneier has called one-way hash functions "the workhorses of
modern cryptography"

## Cryptography primitves

+ One-way hash function.
+ Authentication.
+ Symmetric key cryptography—compute a ciphertext decodable with the same key used to encode (e.g., AES).
+ Public key cryptography—compute a ciphertext decodable with a different key used to encode (e.g., RSA).
+ Digital signatures—confirm the author of a message.
+ Mix network—pool communications from many users to anonymize what came from whom.
+ Private information retrieval—get database information without server knowing which item was requested.
+ Commitment scheme—allows one to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal it later.
+ Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
